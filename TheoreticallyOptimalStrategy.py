def testPolicy(symbol, sd, ed, sv):
    """
    This function simulates a trading policy for a given stock within a specified date range and starting portfolio value. 
    It generates a series of trades based on an unspecified strategy, aiming to optimize the portfolio's performance over the period.

    Parameters:
    - symbol (str): The ticker symbol of the stock to be traded.
    - sd (DateTime): The start date of the trading period.
    - ed (DateTime): The end date of the trading period.
    - sv (float): The starting value of the portfolio.

    Returns:
    - df_trades (DataFrame): A pandas DataFrame indexed by date, with a single column indicating the trade action for each day. 
      The trade actions are represented as follows:
        +1000.0 or +2000.0 for buying 1000 or 2000 shares, respectively,
        -1000.0 or -2000.0 for selling 1000 or 2000 shares, respectively,
        0.0 for making no trade.
      The net holdings are constrained to be within -1000, 0, or +1000 shares at any time.

    Note: The trade strategy implemented by this function is not detailed here and should be defined to optimize the portfolio's performance based on historical data, technical indicators, or any other defined criteria. The implementation of the strategy must ensure that it does not result in a net holding that exceeds the specified constraints.
